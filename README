Turbohearts Score Tracker

This project is a rails site for recording scores for games of Turbohearts you
play with friends. It allows you to enter in a score every game and then
calculates winnings and losses based on these points.

Turbohearts is a card game based on Hearts. The gameplay is primarily the same
as hearts. However, after passing and before playing tricks, cards may be
"charged." Players charge cards by placing them face-up in front of them.
Charged cards are worth double their point effects, and may only be played after 
their suit has been broken or if there is no other option. Additionally, some
cards have extra impacts on the score. The 10 of diamonds, for instance, subtracts
five points from the score if taken. Finally, 9's in any suit force a trick to go
around twice, where the highest of the eight cards played takes the trick.
